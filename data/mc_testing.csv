F EA for Nerfing User Defense. Competitive madden should not reward no skill players who use the D-lineman on defense.  THEY HAVE RUINED COMPETITIVE MADDEN, people that actually have skill andc an read a defense are now PUNISHED, so they can cater to the casual dan., **** THIS GAME. im buying fifa instead.

This years madden is the exact same game as the previous 5 madden games with very minor changes they added the yard which was fun for the first ten to fifteen minutes after realizing how easy/boring it was and realizing that if you want to look cool on the yard you will need to drop an additional 15-20 dollars on an already 60 dollar unfinished game the face of the franchise is extremely boring and is clearly unfinished with the same cutscenes over and over with you practically choosing between terrible options and unrealistic moves such as your team trading for Patrick mahones if you choose to be a running back and also in college when you go out and drop 100+ points easily in the CFP you’re hit with a scene that basically says your injured backup will be taking over the starting position and you can either switch positions or declare for the draft and once again you’re hit with another cutscene with the media that will be a reoccurring cutscene time and time again there are many glitches in the game that have yet to be fixed almost a month into the release such as once you enter the NFL it says that you attended a different college that was not even an option to go to when your team gets hit with an injury for example I was a RB on the cardinals and it said on screen that kyler Murray will be out for two games in the playoffs with an injury and then the very next text on the screen says kyler Hopkins will be out for two games im guessing a mix between deandre Hopkins and kyler Murray also I find it very aggravating that if you wish to switch to the classic franchise mode layout you will lose all your leaderboard score and will never be able to get it back basically forcing you to play in a stupid simulation where you can only play at max 3-4 games every season and then once you have your player to a 95+ you’re hit with an injury bug that places your ratings -20 to all ratings and you lose your superstar development and X factor only to have it replaced if you achieve an unfair stat line a few short games later making everyone wonder why you would even need to be injured in the first place and then to top it all off you’re forced to retire after only 7 seasons in the league when you’re at the ripe age of 30 I don’t even need to say anything about the franchise mode except if you’ve played madden 16’s franchise mode you’ll see that it is the exact same with very and I mean very few changes ultimate team is the same as well charging a stupid amount of money if you want to even have a chance at competing with other players online and the gameplay is very annoying for instance if you play with the cover athlete Lamar Jackson and try to scramble out of the pocket you’ll notice that he is extremely slow until you pass the line of scrimmage making it impossible to make a huge gain as you’ll be chased down by 350 pound players that have 60 speed before you can even make it 5 yards past the line of scrimmage receivers  seem to never hold onto the ball once they are hit with contact almost always resulting in a dropped pass or a fumble and in some cases a tipped interception that somehow the defensive ai will be able to make a diving insane interception all-pro difficulty is way too easy but with all-madden you’ll see yourself down 28-0 before you even know it the only good thing about this game is that there is a new cover that someone EA has even copied the same cover style in the loading screen for 3+ years making this game essentially a 60$ update or patch EA would be so much better off if they just released a madden game that came out with FREE updates every year but as we all know that is simply asking too much from a company that basically robs its customers with a hefty 60$ price tag and then forcing you to pay 10-20 and something up to 100$ to even compete with the best players as a result they are left with angry customers every year and all they have to show for it is empty promises that they somehow seem to forget every year a new game is due to come out… Expand

The game is by far the most atrocious football game in history, making Maximum Football, and Axis football higher ranked for me. It lacks in-depth look into franchise that was promised. This game stole my dollars. Madden 20 is even better, and much like EA's reputation. EA has been going backwards ever since the Madden 15 game. The game while expanded the story of Face of the Franchise had many bugs, and a very very cheesy storyline. I have given the game well over 3 weeks to pan out, and get the bugs all out, but they haven't panned out. EA's newest update is a glorified Colin Kaepernick just to get themselves out of updating what matters. They have shipped the game off with the heart and sole purpose of the game being microtransactions. EA has had the same franchise mode with an updated menu screens for the past 5 years. It lacks in-depth look into scouting, it lacks realistic player IQ. Lacks IQ for blocking. Relies upon animations based on pre-scripted plays. So the animations bug into unrealistic movements. The game generally plays the same as previous years, but has an Overpowered, but fun Defensive line mechanics. The franchise mode can't even get the right playoff picture same as last year with the 4 division leaders, and still 2 wild cards with however many teams are in the hunt. Despite NFL making the 7 seeded conference playoffs. MUT menu screens aren't worth your time as far as how slow the screens are, and overall not worth your time at all just wasting time spending your money on a team that will be irrelevant in 1 year time. Players glitch threw players all the time. CPU roughing the kicker, and roughing the passer calls are off the charts hitting a penalty mark that took the irl NFL 5 years. Games newest mode The yard is okay if you are an online person you will love it, but I am like many others a franchise mode. This game is a copy and paste of Madden 20 with an added The Yard feature. I will rate this the lowest score because worse than the game itself EA will not listen to this feedback anyway so what's the point in making it a higher score. EA has not understood the mechanics and will not build a new code despite all knowledge of using a first person shooter to run a football game. The only thing this game has that is better than others is maybe an up to par amount of graphics, and the NFL exclusive copyright. Therefore #NFLdropEA and #EndMaddenMonopoly should be highest as this game is an embarrassment to the community and the fans. The game is made by people with no heart, or interest in football only getting their microtransactions.… Expand

I had to write my first review because of this game....I REALLY REALLY tried to like this game but there are too many issues that you cant ignore after awhile. You can tell the developers were forced to rush out a broken game before the start  of the season for $$$ and will be patching it continuously throughout the year. Franchise is EXACTLY the same. Game play feels slightly differentI had to write my first review because of this game....I REALLY REALLY tried to like this game but there are too many issues that you cant ignore after awhile. You can tell the developers were forced to rush out a broken game before the start  of the season for $$$ and will be patching it continuously throughout the year. Franchise is EXACTLY the same. Game play feels slightly different but not complete. Face of Franchise is SUCH A PROMISING mode, it has LOADS of potential. The NFL is a league of drama and they had a real chance here. The mode is fun but very broken. First off, before the 1.08 patch, you were ALWAYS drafted to the Chicago Bears if you chose to be drafted. This was the first indication of an issue but i let it go. The goal for each game was so ridiculous at times. I had one game where my goal was to score 6 TD's. It was my 2nd year as a starter, and the coach wanted me to score 6 TDs?? This mode feels like a half-hearted attempt at mashing together Road To the Show and March to October from the MLB the Show series. I really liked how you could play 1-3 games per season and still progress. I liked how you could decide which players your team could sign or trade at certain points. I liked how you decisions affected the team, like sitting during a playoff game instead of triyng to fight through an injury. My teammates didnt think i was tough and lost faith in me. It all felt true to life. I was truly excited with this mode. I decided to start a brand new Face of the Franchise and see what different options i could unlock. Right away, Again drafted by the Bears, then the story repeats itself to a T. There was no difference in any decisions they all led to the same outcome. If you decide to leave the Bears and leave it up to fate, you ALWAYS end up on the Houston Texans. I can go down a list of all the small things broken in this mode. I wish there was a faster option to skip all the cut-scenes and games rather than waiting or super sim. When your drafted, you dont know when your picked. When you go to your card to look at the round and pick you were taken, its wrongly written. The draft pick number showed as pick 511. There's many more but im not gonna waste anymore space on it.  Its a broken mode but has so much promise. EA could really capture the drama of the NFL but continues to miss. Gameplay is a huge problem. While i feel the gameplay is much more open and fluid than years past, the game has so many bugs it ruins it. Some plays you feel the frame rate stutter so it throws off your timing. Stat overlays show up blank or with random numbers. Dont bother with the sliders that come with the game. If you play on all-Madden, its nothing but cheese. Your recievers will drop open passes, your defenders will continue to miss tackles. You will not be able to break tackles, Your quarterback will throw passes off target randomly with no pressure on you. I played a game as the ravens and as LAMAR JACKSON, i was unable to scramble away from defensive ends and get the edge. I had D-Lineman catching up to Lamar like it was no issue. The Quarterback scrambling needs to be overhauled and this year with LJ as the cover athlete would have been the perfect year. Im truly disappointed in this game. While i felt at moment smooth gameplay, it was instantly ruined with some kind of bug or issue to remind me im playing an EA title with no outside competition on the market. Another gameplay issue which im still BAFFLED by is running RPO's. I know it was introduced in last years game. I remember trying to run it in Madden 20 and everytime receiving a penalty for an Ineligible receiver downfield. Your lineman are programmed and get sucked into the defender in front of them. This play each time would force the Center or Right Guard down field block a linebacker. I figured this was broken last year and it was new, so i ignordd this part of the playbook. Low and Behoid, i try to run an RPO this year in Madden 21, and THE SAME EXACT THING EACH TIME. THEY NEVER FIXED THIS HUGELY REPORTED ISSUE. I was actually amazed at how easily this company ignores bugs. I cant fathom how they ignore their customers every year and continue to hold a monopoly on the NFL. The Yard was the only mode given any attention. Its all about money to EA. Developers need competition to bring out the best. Its a real shame that in our lifetime, we were teased with a perfect football game, ESPN 2k5, and now handcuffed to this garbage everyyear. I still find myself popping in 2k5 to really enjoy a football simulation game. Bottom Line, If your into gimmicks and  bells and whistles, not into actual football, or dont want to play 11 v 11 like a football simulation should be; The Yard is the perfect mode for you. Otherwise save you money. NFL PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DROP EA. #NFLDROPEA… Expand

It's basically Madden 20 only it got worse this time: The gameplay is completely unrealistic and always scripted with very poor animation. So it can often happen that a tackle animation is carried out, although the defender is still stuck in a block of an O-Liner or WR, and this then slips through the O-Liner just so that the tackle animation works, which is simply illogical .

One can also say: the players do not understand the basics of football.In addition, the game has more bugs and glitches than ever before in a Madden title. And unfortunately you can also see that EA makes zero effort to improve / repair the game, let alone to feed Madden with new features (Classic franchise untouched for 8 years). This year's Face of the Franchise mode is hideous, filled with bad animations / interactions of the characters, with gruesome voices and the story itself just doesn't make any sense! The only thing that shows potential in this game is this year's The Yard mode, but this is also often not playable at the moment (the playing field turns white, as if aliens are ruling the world). If it works perfectly, it's also a lot of fun, but then it's a lot like arcade. This is by far the worst Madden I've played in the last decade. Do yourself a favor to not buy this crappy game!

Game is not fun and you have to rely on animations to win. No skill in this game. No one is original running their own schemes because the game is so broken everyone runs the same formation and play because they are simply BROKEN. FIX THE GAME!!!!!… Expand

So I am dying to know why EA sports continue to use an unrealistic algorithm to dictate coverage. For example: If I am in a 4WR set with 3 wideouts running verticals and one coming across the middle. How is it that the DB on the far right with deep zone response abilities (meaning he can not get beat deep because he has no help) break on the ball being thrown to the crossing receiver?????So I am dying to know why EA sports continue to use an unrealistic algorithm to dictate coverage.

How is it that the DB on the far right with deep zone response abilities (meaning he can not get beat deep because he has no help) break on the ball being thrown to the crossing receiver????? It is impossible!!!! The wide out the DB is covering is Ty Hill for KC so the only way he'd have a shot at covering him is sprinting north but instead your telling me that he drops his responsibilities the second I throw the ball and not only does a average DB get into position... he actually picks the ball off????This game has been and will continue to be a poor excuse of a football game. 1) A linebacker at the 10 yard line can't intercept a pass when the receiver is at the 34 yard line. 2) One handed tackles while on a block are not that common in the NFL.3) Stop making lower ranked teams drop passes or make the receiver not even attempt to catch the ball because I'm play Baltimore or Seattle. 4) Y'all should really make the end zone bigger because fade routes or back corner routes are a complete joke. 5) Allow teams with good special teams to effect the game. 6) In real football humans make mistakes D line mid sacks. Why can't Qb evade sacks better. All these things are the short reason why Madden 21 sucks. If EA makes no effort to fix this I'm completely done with all EA games.… Expand

An unlawful monopoly exists when one firm controls the market for a product or service, and it has obtained that market power, not because its product or service is superior to others, but by suppressing competition with anticompetitive conduct.EA is a monopoly, and they know it. That’s why each year they produce the same game they did the year before. Only thing different are the rosters. Each year the same players get the good cards and upgrades. But a player the goes off in real life that no ones heard of... EA says nah we only got you as a gold player and we don’t wanna do our job and create a better card for you. And no tribute to other famous hall of game legends because they don’t want to make new content because they already made and use the players from last year. These new LTD players in mut: Ex.Brandin Cooks Going for 2 million coins. EA wants you to buy thousands of dollars in packs to get a “chance” at getting him. Yet people don’t have the money to do that, they buy coins from a 3rd party for cheaper to be able to buy the card. Guess what you’re permanently banned! Banned because you went a cheaper route than EA Monopoly plan to take as much of our money as they can. On top of coin selling being against the rules since they don’t get a slice of the pie, (PROMOTING) the buying and selling of coins are against the rules!

Trash. Constant in game glitches during the “realistic” simulation mode, which is nothing but garbage animations. MUT is a waste of money, all they care about anymore are micro transactions for both MUT and The Yard game modes. Oh hey cool, mouth pieces... that do nothing but glitch like crazy, good thing there isn’t a replay in The Yard game mode, right EA? Wasted $60 on this game only to see they can’t give it away to get people to play it. Brick and mortar stores can’t discount it enough to sell it, even Origin has it discounted down to approximately $40 for those who owned Madden 20. What a joke, EA should be ashamed and the NFL needs to revoke the exclusivity deal with them immediately and let 2K Sports and others have a shot.… Expand

For this year's edition of Madden NFL 21, I gave it a 6/10. Most of the points are for graphics, this game hasn't changed much since last year's edition which is why it's only a 6/10.

Most of the points are for graphics, this game hasn't changed much since last year's edition which is why it's only a 6/10. Many have reported bugs and issues with the game, while I am not discrediting them, I am reviewing off of my experience and I haven't seen many bugs in the game.  The most noticeable differences are the graphics, which are better, and the new O-Line and D-Line mechanics which I tend to prefer over Madden NFL  20. Now on to the bad things, if this game was flawless, it wouldn't be a 6/10. Franchise mode feels uninspired as usual, with little to no effort, and no real change. Bugs that have been in the game for years are still there along with some newer bugs piled on there. Commentary feels exactly the same with only minor changes and a few lines that were altered slightly. Face of the Franchise mode is worse than FOtF in Madden NFL 20, the story is cheesy, there are multiple glitches and bugs that take away from the overall immersion. The biggest change for the good in FOtF mode is that you can start the game all the way back in high school, which adds to the overall experience in my opinion. Ultimate Team, like usual is a cash grab that is built on microtransactions and loot boxes rather than real skill and team building.  Superstar KO is essentially the same mode as it was in Madden NFL 20. I would say that the biggest addition to the game is the mode ""The Yard"" but even that mode feels generally uninspired. There is much to be improved on for Madden NFL 22, considering that the biggest changes from Madden NFL 20 to Madden NFL 21 being colorful uniforms, mouthguards, and better graphics.In conclusion, if you have Madden NFL 20, I recommend that you stay with that because Madden NFL 20 is the far better game. If you haven't played madden before, I recommend Madden NFL 20 over this any day, the only situation where I could see someone buying this game would be for the roster update and new teams.… Expand

After years of playing a game that's just basically a roster update with a few new things in it, this year might be the culmination of suck. Possibly the worst Madden yet. Franchise mode is the same as previous 2 years, they couldn't even change the celebrations after Superbowl victories. FoF is a joke compared to previous season. Your character only has a 7 season career no matter which position you play, only 3 choices BTW, and they make it seem like it was a 20yr career. That was dumb. The Yard is ok but the stuff they have in the Yard is basically  NFL Street washed down with microtransaction opportunities.  Honestly wondering why they didn't add some of the Yards customization to Franchise mode, would've been a step up. This game is glitch trash thats worse then previous outings...can't wait til EA gets some competition,  then maybe thier product will get better.… Expand

You are paying $60 dollars for a roster update that has pictures of the rookies. Franchise mode is copied and paste. Superstar KO and The Yard are subpar and cheesy game modes that get stale or broken quickly. There is a lack of depth in the game all in all. The computer in franchise mode will cheese and rob you unless you play immaculate defense, and even so sometimes the computer will just refuse to get tackled, drop a catch, get sacked, throw an incompletion, etc. You are much better off just updating the rosters in madden 20 if you are a franchise player like I am. I haven’t even seen a ref at all, where are the OC’s and DC’s? Regression system is still trash. You still can not adjust the amount of money you want to pay a free agent unless it’s the off-season. Their so called “ Big Updates” probably took only 5 mins because it’s all mostly cosmetic. No team customizations still. What the actual **** is Face of the Franchise. You can do that in franchise mode at any position , but only gives you a QB for that specific game mode. EA servers are down half the time. Trades in real life are not even close to the trades in madden. The little things in football are completely forgotten in the game. If you have never played football before you would not be able to learn it playing this game. Matter of fact, I’m pretty sure not a single developer in their staff has even seen or played football before. I love football, I grew watching it and playing it. The only football game available now is madden so we are forced to play this dumpster fire. I remember when NFL Blitz , NFL Street, and NCAA were still being made people would play the **** outta them. Now that EA has exclusive rights they have gotten lazy and sloppy because they know they have no competition.#NFLDROPEA EA yal trash af dawg like damn bruh I’m extra disappointed $60 straight down the drain.

There is only a focus on MUT so EA can fill their coffers with more of your hard earned money with their minimal effort product. I have absolutely zero experience in game design, but if I wanted to create a better NFL football game, I could do better than this crap. This game is buggy, player movement is the worst of all time because it isn’t even authentic, the game is entirely animation based so you may have a receiver triple covered but if you throw it up to him and get lucky, that defender will just bounce off and your receiver will get a simple one handed catch over three guys. Tackling behind the line of scrimmage? Non-existent, not only will your player not make the secure tackle 80% of the time, your other ten players will just not even try for the rest of the play as their running back goes for their 5th 40+ yard Touchdown run of the game. Oh and if you are so lucky to actually get thrown into a tackle animation, your player will probably just throw the running’s back for a first down anyway because EA has no concept of hitting low and driving a guy backwards. EA doesn’t know how football works, their development team definitely does not watch football, and neither does the ratings adjuster. Aaron Rodgers, arguably one of the greatest QBs of all time is only an 89? Micheal Thomas, who only runs 5 yard slants all game, is 99 ovr? I can run 5 yard slants against nfl corners because anyone on the planet can. All in all, this game is a piece of **** If you don’t think the 0.2 user score is enough, I suspect you probably have some similar mental disability to the developers at EA, I heard it was diagnosed as “stupidity”. #NFLdropEA #FixFranchiseMode… Expand

It starts out fine but all of a sudden in your fourth year as a starting QB the media is saying you’re old? Like you don’t have much time left in the NFL? Patrick Mahomes is in his fourth year and nobody is saying he’s old. That’s younger than the dude who’s on the damn cover! And as you keep playing you realize why the game is having everyone think you’re old and washed; because the game forces your career to end after year eight. That’s the equivalent of Russell Wilson retiring after last year. Not due to a career ending injury or any other reason that would at least be plausible, no because madden thinks you’re too old to play QB after 8 seasons. You then get the ending cutscene in which your high school stadium is named after you. Which is great except…there’s no audio. No pre-recorded dialogue or anything. The rest of the mode has dialogue, but the ending cutscene? Nope. And when I say no audio I mean no audio. No music or anything.

I just wish the NFL would wise up and break their contract with EA and give another developer a shot to make a decent football game but alas people are dumb and will keep buying the heaping pile of **** that is madden year in and year out(note I did not buy this steaming abortion, my buddy whom I game share with did)… Expand

X factors and abilities should be patched so they are not as Overpowering or just have a setting in exhibition and franchise where you can turn them off altogether.  Gameplay the exact same as madden 20 with an added jurdle and dead leg. The gameplay still sucks your mike Evan’s will catch an easy ball just for a 180 pound corner to hit him and  the ball goes flying. Quarterbacks fumble way too often while running the ball. Unless you literally have truzz activated you’ll fumble one out of 3 times in open field. Franchise is the exact same thing but made the menus blue. They finally added a playoff bracket which should have been in the game years ago. Also they added a retirement screen which has been in nba  2k for years . Even MUT the only game mode madden cares about rarely gets updates that aren’t new packs and players to waste money on. The yard is buggy and is not fun after 4 minutes of playing. Superstar KO just changed up the teams a bit and updated the X factor playeRs and legends. Quarterback throwing is very unrealistic they throw on the run cross body perfectly. Then on a wide open sit route over the middle the throw it nowhere near the receiver .  You can only sign free agents to 1 year contracts that you can’t edit the amount you actually pay the player. Certain teams are really good in simulations in franchise basically the browns every year. They always make the super bowl or go 13-3 and get the 1 seed . The scouting has been the exact same for years . They should add back slow development which they had in previous games. Because 43 year old Tom Brady is developing faster than the number one overall pick in the draft . You rarely see another non user controlled team draft a 70 plus overall steal in the 5 round or later . Yet you find 7th round projected players with 1st round talent . It’s rare for players to retire after 40 that are under the age of 35 in the league right now. Everything about madden is really just awful.

Instead of making players realistic and unique to their skill sets, madden gives star players overpowered and unrealistic X factors, that allow the leagues star players to commit on field actions which are impossible in real life. Aside from being unrealistic and an arcade football game, madden 21 has the worst gameplay out of any madden I’ve ever played. Madden 21 makes it impossible for a user to complete a pass of 25+ yards, it is impossible to relastically float a ball over a defender no matter which pass you choose to throw, and over 80% of these types of passes result in turnovers. Games made over 13 years ago like NFL 2k, or madden 11 have smoother, cleaner, and better gameplay. In madden 21 there are a total of 15 tackle animations, when in nfl 2k and madden 11 the same annimatioj is never repeated and is unquie to each play. Not only is maddens gameplay bad, so is its ultimate team mode. Madden has made it nearly impossible to earn things in the game without spending money, making the game pay to win. Not only this but simple things such as kickoffs, or onside kicks, have been removed from the game because it’s creators cannot fix bugs. Overall, madden is not a simulation nfl football game, and is one of the worst games I have ever played. -Chris C… Expand

The most glaring is the bug when rushing the QB, when you break free of a defender the AI will more often than not suck you to another defender even if you have a clear shot at the QB. I guess they are magnetic. Extra points are meaningless, click, click, and score. My percentage for 4th down conversions must be nearly 95%. Not once did I worry about 3 and out. On a running play a defender can reach out and tackle you with one hand. The play selection is exactly the same - you can win every game in a season with 5-6 plays - no need to change them up which means the AI teams play like they've never watched a tape from the previous week. It's not hard to program an increased difficulty to affect the success of running your favorite plays. The franchise management, contracts, recruiting - has the worst UI. Why do I have to click over and over to load the same screen of data for different players? And why does it take a second to load textual content changes - nothing has changed between player 1 and 2? Most of these issues are very similar to what I remember from 10+ years ago. Worst off all, the player movement animation hasn't improved - they still look like they are floating above the field.

These schemes include heavily advertised and slapping ""new"" shiny game-modes onto their game that usually boil down to a simple change of house rules, or a new monetization scam aimed to exploit young children and sports fans out of their money using gambling mechanics. Young fans are greeted at the games menus with constant pop ups advertising ultimate team, a gamemode where players can gamble their money to try and get better overall players on their fantasy team. You will be most likely be matched against players who have the shiny new high overall cards making players want to skip the impossibly long grind and opt to purchase packs in hopes to compete with other online players, only for any and all progress in the mode to be reset when their next game(roster update) releases. Fan favorite modes and features are consistently removed, the player customization is one of the most barebones lazy attempts I've seen in gaming (maybe 6 face options per skin tone that have remained the same for years). Mouthguard's and other customization accessories were added finally but only exclusive to their heavily monetized arcade mode ""The Yard"". Franchise mode completely untouched aside from a recolored menu. No dynamic storylines or career situations. Stale and repetitive in game commentary that pales in comparison to Nba 2K's, and doesn't seem to have been significantly updated in years. Face of the franchise, an extremely unpopular mode from last year seemed to have gotten more attention than most other modes but simply added options to play more years in college. Voice acting and story is horrendous and incredibly uninspired. Overall the game is the same garbage players have been provided for years. NFL execs likely dont care since the money from Ultimate team flies in, but giving the egregiously terrible EA the sole rights to produce ""simulation NFL"" games is still proving to be a mistake. EA does not care what the consumer thinks when they rake in billions from their sports games. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,  Its time players start to hurt EA's pockets until they decide to give a **** about the quality of this their manipulative and exploitative excuses of roster updates.… Expand

Your “simulation-styled” football game is nothing more than a money-grabbing carbon-copy of the madden games of recent past. Not to mention, it’s actually worse! EA Sports should either be banned from any affiliation with the NFL, or the NFL should reconfigure their contract so that exclusivity within EA’s rights should be no longer. The issue is EA Sports has all of the money and brain power in the world to create the greatest titles of NFL football video games ever. They don’t and let me tell you why: it’s simple, they’ve become complacent and it seems their audience and what they pride themselves on as developers is the very opposite. Not only was the *new* face of the franchise the most scripted, minimalistic, and childish storyline ever, but the *new* ‘Yard,’ FOF’s counterpart, was so nothing but a money grab. That’s right, you can now spend your V-bucks on Ultimate Team packs AND useless cosmetics for a monotonous game mode that’s aimed towards 8-year-olds! I don’t have the willpower to get into the biggest letdown of them all, especially since EA and the madden franchise prides themselves on its unique “simulation” experience. That letdown being the franchise feature. If EA Sports doesn’t completely revitalize Madden 22 into a realistic, simulation-style video game whose main priority is franchise first and micro transactions last, then they better say goodbye to the NFL and the Madden franchise as a whole.Outside of the sickening franchise mode, the basic graphics within the game are hysterical for the year 2020-2021. First and foremost, until an immersive halftime/postgame show in implemented, there’s no cleaning up this mess. With that being said, the sidelines are ridiculous. Not only are there literal bots with what look like fake uniforms/numbers/etc., but the lack of coaches and camaraderie as a team really drives the game even further down. When a team is traveling for an away game, there should be more cutscenes or features. The week-by-week basis should feel refreshing as it almost never seems like it’s repeating. I get that’s hard to do when certain critics will play a game just to look for downfalls, but the effort to preventing this could easily prevent a 0.2 user score in the future. Moving forward, like I said with home/away games, they should matter! Include the situation (fighting for a playoff spot/division rival/etc) so that the game is that much more intense and real as it goes on. For example, I’m the Steelers traveling to the Cincinnati: there should be so much tension between the players, fans, etc that the game should feel and be harder. These are all simple things that FOOTBALL FANS care about and want to see. The Madden community that has invested so much time and effort into enjoying your game and even promoting it deserve much more than what we’ve been given. This wasn’t the only year any of these things have been issues, this was just the first year in which we as a community felt it was time to put our foot down as the consumer.… Expand

This game is awful every year and it never seems to get better. I’m just going to talk about gameplay. Offense is ridiculously overpowered if you are a good player, there is always a route that’s wide open no matter what play you ran. If you throw an RPO against a run committed defense, it gets picked off. Like what? The defense is supposed to sell out for the run yet get a pick 6?

If you throw an RPO against a run committed defense, it gets picked off. Like what? The defense is supposed to sell out for the run yet get a pick 6? Also, users on defense can literally run 15-20 yards in less than a seconds from a standing motion. The game hardly even relies on skill, it’s more just about what animations you get. The game needs serious fixing on everything, also speed is like the most important stat for wide receivers to get open, when it is not at all in real life. EA needs to stop calling madden a “simulation football game” because it is the furthest thing from that. The game needs a total overhaul when it comes to gameplay.… Expand

of the American football. Sadly, most of the modes remained the same. Gameplay
received a few minor tweaks, and in the end it still persists as a cash grab not worth

It does look beautiful graphically, but that’s about where it ends. Glitches happen with the screen turning almost entirely white, kicking field goals is difficult due to graphical lag, and other less frequent glitches. Players feel stiff and unresponsive, which to some degree adds some realism. But the AI makes all sorts of poor decision. Playing on all madden is nearly impossible without heavily adjusting the sliders. Computer QB will frequently be at 80-90% accuracy while averaging 10 yards a throw. Pass rush is non-existent with computers having 5 seconds or more to throw on most passes. Conversely the player QB with have errant throws to open receivers every 5th throw. Receivers that are touched at all in making the catch will drop balls. Computer defensive reaction time and ability to redirect is insane when they have their back to the ball. Players offensive line holds up for about 3 seconds, which is fine if it went both ways. Some much of it feels out of whack and it’s just not a whole lot of fun.… Expand

Worst game I have purchased in 20 years.  Pre-determined outcomes based on animations, freezes and lags during field goal kicking, copy and past game development from previous 2 years (even accidentally left Madden 19 banners in the game), there is a lack of user control of players, defensive backs catch better than WR's, glitches during trick play, the list goes on and on.  It is almost as though EA didn't test their game before releasing it.  Please do not buy.  We need to boycott EA so that the NFL will drop them.

They claim to spend hours and hours of time improving aspects of the game but somehow manage to produce a game that is not even playable.

Man coverage occasionally works, there are no good zone plays, the pass plays either work way to well, or they get blown up by a 65 overall left end or a **** safety jumps the route from 75 kilometers away.I usually play fantasy draft leagues with my friends which is insanely fun however all you need is a decent running game and good pass rush and a fast linebacker and you’ll win every time. That is if your playing a real person. If you are playing the ai on the only playable difficulty, All Madden, you can’t juke **** or run over anyone. They never do anything risky like hit stick so you can hurdle juke or truck. They just conservative tackle you into oblivion. You get about 4 to 5 yards every play but often you can’t take risks either. If you even try to do a pass 20 yards down the field, on a man to man play mind you, the coverage will miraculously switch to zone and 3 other DBs will ride the Wide outs dick and pick the ball or force and incompletion.Due to all of this madden has become nothing but a heaping pile of stinky **** and the department of Ea who made this needs to be shut down and be sued for fraud.

That would be overwhelming to most people I imagine, learning all of them is quite the task, so during my playthrough I used only a handful of them, which work with my playstyle.- Battlemode does not sound that interesting to me, sure you have other players with you, but the amount of demons you get during the campaign would be quite enough. That said I have not actually played it, as the campaign is what matters to me.- The ""story"" is more serious, so to speak, in this one, which doesn't appeal to me and I would imagine it won't appeal to others too.

The side missions and activities are so bland and a waste of time that I ignored them after following a man ""sleepwalking"" for 200m and after chatting with him the side quest was finished, you would only do these uninspiring side quests just to get EXP to level your character. The RPG system, the notorious RPG system is back and it's a grind. The reason Ubisoft deliberately added the RPG system to the game again is to make money out of it, crafting and upgrading in this game requires materials such as metals, leather and fabric in which you need to acquire exploring the ludicrously large map and the required amount of materials to upgrade gears is in the range of 10-100. The amount you collect are single units thus making it a grind to collect them. The combat in Valhalla feels clunky compared to the previous title. The combat animation is slow and unpleasant, intentionally due to the stamina system that's implemented. The story is below average as the first few minutes was interesting and for there it just falls flat on its face, The characters are inmemorable and uninteresting especially the main characters plot in the story.  The plot of the story is in short a revenge story not told well. In short, this is more of a short rant review of the game. I was keen on picking this game up hearing good impressions of early demos from you tubers, but now playing the game I realised this game is not for everyone specially for players that enjoy a good story and good gameplay. Remember that this game was delayed by Ubisoft as well as all the other game titles because of their games having similar gameplay mechanics and here we are with the same game with a Viking skin on and let's not forget that they've added a in-game store that can be spent with real money.UBISOFT HAS NOT LEARNT A THING.… Expand

But in Valhalla...everything is replaced with these colored dots. Even if you go into a fortress and clear it out...there's no feedback letting you know you've accomplished anything. Was there a treasure here? Did I actually complete anything? The only thing you've succeeded in doing it killing a bunch of dudes in a fort. And speaking of ""killing a bunch of dudes"", stealth feels like an afterthought in this game. Sneaking up on an enemy is more difficult and it seems like the enemy placement and number is randomly generated? They are everywhere, they act like lemmings with the IQ of 2, they are never doing anything interesting, wonder aimlessly, but all swarm to the player's position 3 soldiers at a time. So, the map objective have been boiled down into colored dots. At least that will make it easy to find them and check them off the list. Not so fast...a seemingly large percentage of these dots are locked behind unbreakable doors or under the ground. Time to frustratingly waste 5 to 10 minutes looking for a cave entrance for an ultimately uninteresting trinket. The game looks awesome and there are some definite design improvements. The skill tree, ability, and equipment systems have improved in a myriad of ways. The attention to historical detail is astounding and above and beyond what most other game series attempt to do. It's a level of commitment that should be commended. That commendation however shouldn't forgive the poor design choices of the rest of the game's sections. Oh, and the whole ""Chase and catch the floating paper!"" minigame has made its return...… Expand

The world feels small, the enemies are either super easy or super hard, the bow is the best weapon, no need to actually go stealthy (in the mission where you have to learn where the king of Mercia is hiding you need to get the info from some lady in a tight security fortress and it was easy as cake to just jump in and kill everyone Rambo style), the way they emphasize you're creating your own story feels over exaggerated cause I feel like I can count on one hand how many times I've had to pick my own dialogue option, the game is generally clunky as in your character goes everywhere, the weapon animations are very repeating so you get tired of them quickly, the finishers are all the same on on each class as in the standard bearer has one and so on, and I dont feel like the order of the ancients or whatever has been tied in to the main quest at ALL.

Controller disconnection doesn't pause the game. When the game pauses you get the keyboard pop ups. Overall a bad port at about the glitchiness of unity.

But Valhalla is a step back to frustration, bugs, moving away from the shadowy creed we all love. Poor controls often let you down when sneaking and turn a game of shadows into a repetitive hack and slash bore. It would have been ok if the fighting was any good, but somehow they messed that up. Without spoiling too much, there is a place similar to that odd tropical island in RDR2 that I just can't understand why they added to the game. You play a bloodthirsty viking in a foreign land, but too often do you have to engage in politics (walk around and talk to different people) and compete in rhyme (game of words). Graphics are also a rather big step back from the latest 2 instalments that were very impressive. And don't get me started on the singing. I want to run that longboat aground as soon as the *** crew starts that tedious mumbling. Any psalm is more upbeat than that torture. Vikings high on mushrooms going on a raid, and you think that is the sort of songs they chant? I will most likely play through this one as well, but it's just due to lack of options right now.

Combat system took a little time to get used to but soon found weapons and tactics I was happy with. The main problem I have with this game/Ubisoft is although they have spent a lot of time producing this, it still feels like a re-skin of the previous games and the bugs from them still exist. I always feel that they will never reach the heights of Rockstar because they are too concerned with hitting deadlines/profits then making a game a work of art.… Expand

It's a good looking game, however it has nothing to do with Assassin's Creed. It's main focus is on farming.  Poor stealth system. A point for a nice graphics and soundtrack.

I understand that Ubisoft are trying to make the game more modern but it’s lost a lot of what made Assassin’s Creed so fun to play. The last Assassin’s Creed game that I think was fun to play and stuck to the Assassin’s Creed style of play was Syndicate. Valhalla is much more of an open-world adventure game and is about going around a pretty unpopulated England making alliances. The story never pulled me in and the main story is so loose and is tied to building houses in your settlement. At many time I was lost and thinking how do I advance the story.I’m from England and I love playing games set in the country or city that I live in. However, England in this game, as a setting, is not very interesting. The towns and Cities are small with some exceptions. There are no massive cities which you can freely free run around and now the free-running mechanic is basically gone and now all you climb are some cliffs and small buildings. It might just be me but it doesn’t feel like an Assassin’s Creed game anymore. Some people might really like the new games but I just don’t know.(I quite liked Unity so my opinions may not be super valid)… Expand

I’m more disappointed than happy about this AC. The story is ok but it’s missing the big reason why you want to have everyone as an ally. And the fight system is better than origins and odyssey. Also the world looks good. BUT. The Parcours system is trash and I don’t know why but the developers wanted to show how bad it is so they put in some “catch me if you can” thing in it. Never liked it, never will. The game is too packed with small checklist stuff. I have to say that it is nice to have one weapon that you can upgrade from bad to best. But the variety is not there. The simplest and most common weapon is not even included in this game... why is there no normal sword!? I never had a game where I was exhausted before I even started the actual game but Ubisoft did it with AC Valhalla. Thinking about playing this game was good for the first 3 days but then it got boring and it takes too much time away with boring stuff. I think the time of AC has come to an end. Oh and by the way. There is a leveling system in this game. They just gave it another name (power level) but you still have to grind so that you can keep up in a fight, otherwise you get destroyed within one attack. Well played Ubisoft. I’m done with them and AC.… Expand

It manages to avoid the tropes that became overplayed and focuses on a small well structured story. The fighting mechanics are enjoyable and offer many choices to fit different playing styles. There are a significant amount of bugs and the AI is underwhelming at times. But it's still another step in the right direction for Ubisoft.

Hay otros tres lugares accesibles en el juego, pero entraría en territorio de spoilers, así que solo diré que no están tan bien realizados como los 2 principales y dejan mucho que desear. El combate se basa en un sistema de postura, por decirlo de alguna manera, los enemigos tienen una barra amarilla abajo de su vida la cual disminuye al atacar, bloquear, bloquear perfectamente y dispararles en sus puntos débiles, de los cuales los métodos mas efectivos son los dos últimos, cuando esta barrita se vacía, eivor es capaz de realizar un ataque aturdidor, el cual elimina por completo a la mayoría de los enemigos exceptuando a los jefes a los cuales les quita un gran trozo de su vida, este sistema incrementa increíblemente la utilidad de las armas a distancia, lo cual es un gran plus ya que estas se sentían completamente inútiles en muchas entregas pasadas. Incluso ignorando por completo este sistema, los ataques de eivor quitan una gran porción de vida, lo cual se agradece después de explotar mi dedo presionando R1 y R2 cientos de veces solo para eliminar un enemigo común en AC odyssey. Mencionando AC odyssey las habilidades de este vuelven en esta entrega, pero al igual que en odyssey, muchas se sienten obsoletas comparadas con la utilidad de otras, causando que durante tu tiempo de juego te apegues a 1 o 2. Hay una gran variedad de armas cuerpo a cuerpo y combinaciones que puedes utilizar para derrotar a tus enemigos, pero el juego nunca hace nada para diferenciarlas sustancialmente, causando que el jugador nunca sienta la necesidad de cambiar su equipamiento, y por ende todo el esfuerzo que hizo el equipo en modelar diferentes armas y crear distintas animaciones para cada combinación de armas, se sienta en vano. En lo que respecta a armas de distancia, existen 3 tipos, el arco depredador (preciso, el juego cambia a una perspectiva de primera persona cuando apuntas a este arco), el arco de cazador (el clásico, se controla y se siente igual que todos los arcos de todos los juegos con arco) y por ultimo el arco rapido (este sirve para encuentros cercanos), a la hora de combatir frente a frente, el mejor de todos es el rápido, puedes hacer llover flechas sobre los enemigos y fácilmente darles en sus puntos débiles para aturdirlos y el peor frente a frente obviamente es el depredador, ya que se torna molesto que la cámara cambie cada vez que quieras dispararlo, e incluso cuando los comparamos en una situación de sigilo, el depredador es vencido por el cazador, el cual logra un daño similar o incluso mejor, y te permite llevar muchas mas flechas. Aun con esto dicho se podría decir que los tres arcos tienen sus utilidades y son suficientemente diferentes entre si que el jugador va a usar los 3 al menos un par de veces durante su partida. En lo que respecta al sigilo, este AC intenta volver a sus raíces, trayendo de vuelta la habilidad de esconderse a plena vista y de pagarle a alguien para que distraiga a los guardias, la cual esta realizada decentemente, pero aun así no llega a ser tan prevalente como lo fue en la trilogía de Ezio. Además esconderte en plena vista el juego también te permite esconderte entre la hierba alta, así como en las 2 entregas anteriores a esta, y ,como en todos los AC, te permite esconderte en montones de paja y hojas. En resumen, el sigilo ha sido el mejor en esta trilogía con estilo rpg, pero aun así deja mucho que desear, y se queda corto ante el sigilo en AC2 o Unity. Rápidamente mencionare que el parkour es igualito a los dos pasados, lo cual es muy decepcionante sabiendo que pueden hacer parkour con la precisión de AC2 y la fluidez y animaciones de Unity. La historia del juego se divide en 4, la historia de Eivor, el conflicto entre templarios y asesinos, la historia de Inglaterra y la historia moderna. La historia de eivor es bastante buena, con diferentes giros y decisiones que tienen impacto en tu final, esta es probablemente la mejor escrita del juego. El conflicto entre templarios y asesinos sobrepasa en leguas al de Odyssey, en verdad se siente la presencia templaria en inglaterra, y nosotros con nuestra hoja oculta debemos deshacernos de ella, este sentimiento de asesino solo se agrava gracias al regreso de las confesiones. La historia de Inglaterra (la mas larga) es la peor y llega a ser cansina y repetitiva después de las 30 horas en un juego de 60h Y la moderna sorprendentemente arregla el desastre que hizo OdysseySeria un 8 de no ser por los bugs y crasheos constantes… Expand

                                Assassins Creed Valhalla is a wonderful addition to the AC franchise. It manages to avoid the tropes that became overplayed and focuses on a small well structured story. The fighting mechanics are enjoyable and offer many choices to fit different playing styles. There are a significant amount of bugs and the AI is underwhelming at times. But it's still another step in the right direction for Ubisoft.

It’s obvious that Ubisoft did its homework and learned from Origins and Odyssey. Valhalla’s story is one of the best not only in the franchise but in the open-world RPG genre. The world is vast but not laden with empty, pointless space. Combat is addicting, character customization is the best the franchise has ever seen, and the welcome return of composer Jesper Kyd makes for one of last year’s most immersive and satisfying experiences.

Wow, a perfect online FPS. It manages to get better every year, like a fine wine or cheese. The ability to break the entirety of the map is so satisfying that you'll forget you have to rescue a hostage or defuse a bomb.

That being said, this is easily THE MOST toxic game/ gaming community I have ever played with. You wanna just sit down and play a casual game after work to unwind? This isn't the game for you! You will get killed by your teammates in almost every casual match you play. There is a good 60% chance that you will get voted out of the game by your team, and a 100% guarantee you'll get voted out if you can't clutch a match even after you entire squad gets slain. But thankfully, there are 2 other playlists for you to enjoy. Unranked: a great playlist for not so casual gamers that push the bounds of ranked gameplay with no active rank tracker. The percentages that you will get team killed/ voted out aren't as high as casual, I'd say those odds are closer to 30%-50%. Ranked: extremely competitive, but definitely the redeeming quality in this game... (is what I would have said if I wrote this review a year ago.) How ranked is set up these days is a joke. You'll again get team killed in nearly every single game you play, on top of not even getting fairly placed into teams to begin with. Oh damn you're a gold rank, thats great were gonna go ahead and match you with some platinums, no big deal. Oh damn your team got utterly crushed by a team that WAY outranks you, that's fine, you deserve to be a lower rank player anyways. You are ranked based off of how your team plays matches, not how you play as an individual. Moving on, the caliber system in this game is an absolute joke. Caveira’s 9mm pistol [67 damage] does more damage than most rifles in the game. In fact her pistol the Lusion (Beretta M9) is the exact same pistol her counterpart (Capitao) [35 damage] has, it just has a different suppressor, and yet some how it does almost twice the damage his does, I mean in what world does that make any sense? In fact Capitao has a Para-308 automatic rifle in his load-out, his .308 caliber rifle does 20 point LESS damage than her 9mm suppressed pistol, WTF is that??? iTs bEcAuSe ShE HaS To Be ComPeTItiVe. If you're not big on gun calibers, just do a quick google search on the difference in the size of those rounds, 9mm Vs. .308, it's honestly laughable. If you're trying to be a hyper realistic anti-terrorist-unit game that relies heavily on gun play, then you should at least try to understand the mechanics and calibers of firearms.  A 9mm that does more damage than a .308 is quite hilarious, but when you get killed after dumping 5-6 rounds in her chest and she one shot drops you, that ain’t fun it’s just ridiculous and makes you want to quit. Recoil patterns in this game are laughable. Ela’s Rifle has THE WORST recoil in the game, but it’s the lowest caliber gun in the game, 9mm (while the weapons that are 7.62x39 [AKs] and up have hardly any recoil?), please explain that to anyone who has actually handled a rifle in their life. There are lots of issues with this game that seem trivial but are honestly just game breaking and make those encounters absolutely 1 sided. More so, this game relies HEAVILY on you purchasing cosmetics, which is **** because it lowers the standard of this game to that of Call of Duty/ Fortnite. It’s no fun showing off what you earned when the kid next door takes his moms credit card and buys the skin you worked your ass off for.  It would be nice if someone with actual firearm experience made the weapon systems and platforms, this game tried, but ultimately failed because they were too concerned about operators being ""viable and fair"", (9mm does more damage than an AK, yeah right). Aside from those MAJOR flaws, this game is hella fun if you've got friends to play with, as they probably won't just team kill you/ vote you out. If you do buy this game, you better have the patience of the Dali Lama other wise you're gonna have a really bad time.… Expand

You obviouslyOkay so with the time of me writing this, this game has been active for 5 years now and i think it’s been a good amount of time that I think I can give my opinion on it with good amount of experience i have playing this game. For starters, I absolutely love the whole 5v5 search and destroy type feeling with one life per round. I also like how the operators work in this game. You obviously have stronger operators and weaker operators but it’s still a good system. Another reason why is due to the fact that not all operator shave the same equipment. So that means you have to either coordinate with your team and bring the correct operators that bring that piece of equipment or attack from a whole different area. I also love the destruction that the maps have in each of them. You have obviously soft walls like wood and all you can shoot through but you also have walls you can’t breach or shoot though to which I like. The last thing that I really love is the learning curve this game has. For example, when you first play the game, you will find that you will die to some complete random hole in the wall or some weird angle someone to which is frustrating when you first die to it but then, you learn it and learn how to either counter it or prevent it from happening to which I LOVE mostly about this game. Another thing i like too is the rank system. Now currently, there is a issue that they have in rank and it’s where you would have to pick between 3 maps to ban. Now if both teams ban the same map, then the game will “randomly” select one of the 2 remaining maps left. Now even though that’s great and all, currently there is a issue where it ONLY picks the map on the left to which sucks bit they are working in a fix for that so it’ll be foxed soon i hope. Now another BIG issue that i have on console in general is how DDOSing is a BIG issue right now especially in rank. It has gotten to a point now where almost every rank match i play, I get DDOSed and can’t even get back in causing me to get punished for “leaving the match and not returning.” How ever, it is not mainly Ubisoft’s fault and it is mainly Microsoft’s and Sony’s fault but not completely. Also, a small issue i have with rank is smurf accounts. The reason why i hate it is because it’s the fact that when i lose to some smurfs on the enemy team, I don’t know if I’m just a bad player or maybe i was playing against some Pro League type players to which sucks to go against that because I’m NO WHERE as good as a pro league player for Rainbow Six siege. However, it’s not that big of a issue but it kinda kills  me by giving me a false mindset if i’m actually good of I just suck. But other than that, Rainbow Sox siege is a really great game and I honestly still enjoy playing it from time to time with it’s limited game modes to achieving a high rank or just going into a casual match having fun with my friends.… Expand

This game includes many features I never dreamed of being in a video game before. For all these reasons you must check out Tome Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege.… Expand

It's not horrible, but basically a very short DLC from the Resident Evil 2 remake. If it was $20 that would be about the right price for a good rating. Resident Evil 2  had several mini stories that were separate from the main story that you could play. This game is basically a longer one of those stories.

Su escenario principal como lo es Racoon City es maravilloso y agradable a la vista, también resalto que si Capcom plantea un juego de acción de esta saga, es así como debe ser, balanceado con su Survivor Horror que caracterizó la primera entrega de la saga. Sin embargo lo que es la trama sacrifica lo que es la experiencia jugable, pues decide poner mayor peso a la trama y personajes (que es algo bueno en gran parte) que a la inmersión del terror y pérdida que plantea en un verdadero Resident Evil. Su duración no justifica su precio y quizás si eres un fan puritano de esta franquicia, te diviertas más en una dificultad más alta y un nuevo game plus, del cual menos mal el juego no demora en llegar a eso por los problemas de duración que mencioné anteriormente. Jill Valentine vuelve con toda pero quien no lo hace, es Nemesis, quien se reduce a un mero obstáculo artificial y scriptado según la trama lo necesite. Y quiero resltar, NO SON MUCHOS. Pues a diferencia del Tyrant visto en Resident Evil 2 suponía más una amenaza aleatoria y estresante para el jugador del cual  Nemesis no es capaz de seguir. Y a pesar de sus alucinantes boss fights es un hueco que deja un sabor agridulce al terminar el juego.

The original Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (1999) is by far the most unsettling, intense, and haunting chapter of the original RE trilogy with very good pacing and exploration. It took what came before and injected steroids into it. It was also quite heavy on action, but not overwhelmingly so. What this 'reimagining' did is it got rid of the former (exploration & pacing) and overdosed on the latter (action). Just as Nemesis was removed from the title of the game, you might as well argue he was removed from the game entirely since he was reduced to an extremely scripted occurrence. What the players were teased with was open worlded exploration of Raccoon City as you'd be relentlessly chased by a Mr. X-like enemy. What ended up happening is that you're constantly being pushed in the direction you're supposed to go in an extremely streamlined version of the city (about 50% of the original locations are missing) and the player is incessantly bombarded by scripted action sequences that require barely any input from them to get through besides pressing ""Up.""

По сравнению с оригиналом, они получились более живыми и проработанными, особенно Карлос. Но я очень рад, что каркас главных героев оставили с оригинальной игры и не стали ""изобретать велосипед"". А вот про второстепенных персонажей уже нельзя сказать так однозначно. Некоторые из них претерпели изменения в лучшую сторону, а некоторых показали гораздо халтурнее, нежели в 99 году. В игре очень много положительных аспектов, но есть один весомый минус, о котором нельзя промолчать. Наполнение в игре отличное: стрелять все так же приятно, бегать по городу в поисках отмычек и патронов туда-сюда, так же как и в оригинале сделано - прекрасно. Стычки с Немезисом - напряженные и изматывающие. Но, есть одно ""но,"" - ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МАЛО? Это чувство пришло ко мне после 4-того прохождения на сложности ""инферно"". Вроде все круто и эпично, но вот... мало. Открытое преследование ""Немезиса"", по локациям игры происходит только единожды. Тогда как в оригинале на PS1 этого было намного больше. В остальном, в ремейке он появляется только по скриптам, и то для ""Босс Файта"". И ты понимаешь, что вот круто сделали, но мало...Игра ускоренная, и это обусловлено сюжетом. Но если вы игру ускоряете, то наполните ее -  еще большим контентом. Тоже самое хочется сказать и о загадках, и о всем содержимом внутри игры, а именно - мало. Я прошел игру и выбил платину с удовольствием, но чувство ненасытности, преследовало меня каждый раз на финальных титрах. Игру рекомендую.

After beating this game 3 times now, once on Normal, Hard, & Nightmare mode, I'd say I'm ready to review it. Let me first stick to my positives. Graphically this game is great, maybe even slightly better than RE2 Remake. Nemesis new design is great & more monstrous this time around. The dodge feature from the original RE3 has been improved upon greatly imo, as I never really got the hang of the dodge maneuver from the original. Character wise I liked the updates for Jill & Carlos. The Hospital section of this game is excellent from atmosphere & level design. Also the harder difficulties have good variences as far difficulty as well as enemy placements, well at least on Nightmare mode & Inferno although I haven't beat it on Inferno yet. Now for the negatives & unfortunately there's a lot of negatives for me.I'd say my biggest problem with this game is the it is that Raccoon City is too small & linear to me. The game being short isn't necessarily the issue for me as the original RE3 is short as well, although I took longer to beat it than the Remake the last time I played which was about a month ago. Now I will say it's not that the original RE3 was that big either but that doesn't mean the Remake should have been small as well, after all a great Remake like RE1 adds on to things & locations, not take away from them which goes into my next complaint. To many areas and things cut from the original, like not being able to create stronger ammo for instance. The cut locations from the original RE3 is The Clock Tower, The Newspaper Office, Gas Station unexplorable in Remake, Restaurant unexplorable in Remake, Downtown section is the beginning of the original RE3 & this is unexplorable as well since you can't backtrack to it. City Hall, The Park, The Graveyard & the Dead Factory as well as a few other locations are missing in this Remake. Now I know they replaced the Dead Factory with the Lab in the Remake. I personally prefered the Dead Factory for a number of reasons I won't spoil from the original. Next on the list is the linear structure of this game. In the original you were given these choices on if you wanted to fight Nemesis or do a certain action to get away from him. There were also other choices that didn't involve Nemesis. Also depending on where you went first certain events would come up in the way of a cutcsene. This was unique because you could envail new events that you didn't see on your first playthrough. The Remake is very linear in this regard. You aren't given any choices, & most of the time besides the beginning City area you don't have to backtrack for anything. They could have made it so the areas you go to you have to make a choice on where to go & you can't go everywhere on your first playthrough, because the point is to escape the city but you have these obstacles in the way as well as Nemesis. My last negative is how Nemesis was handled in this Remake. I was hoping for Nemesis to really be a prowler most of this game but he wasn't. Also there's a new character in this game that they introduce & they just kill him off right away. Also the civilians that were shown in the beginning are pointless in this. Later you get the train running but Nemesis kills the civilians & before that point you don't meet or interact with any of them. You don't find any of them in the city so it was a missed opportunity to add more stakes to the story. Also Jill not going to the Police Station is just stupid. I have more cons but I'm already into the review to long now.My verdict for RE3 Remake is it's ok but pales in comparison to the original besides some better updates in the gameplay, mainly being the dodge function.… Expand

You can really customize your play style if you are willing to sacrifice a storage spot. So, even beyond normal, hard, and even harder modes, you can tweak the difficulty from within there with the coins. Jill and Carlos' characters are generally well done, neither too invincible, too weak, too arrogant, nor too obnoxious as are characters in many modern games. The Mikhail villain is a bit overly one-dimensional, though. The upgrades and rewards systems are likewise actually attainable without being ultra-expert level player (like RE2R required) nor playing for a million hours. With moderate to generous repeated gameplay, you can achieve enough weapon kills and other reward points to unlock funner stuff — including the RE trademark infinite weapons which always make for a fun playthrough. There's also a very fun fire knife called Hot Dogger that won't ever break and will set enemies ablaze briefly with every strike.… Expand

Explico: Apesar de não apresentar bugs e estar bonito visualmente, a narrativa e o desenvolvimento de personagens não passa do ordinário, tem apenas 2 puzzles que são ridículos de fáceis e não requerem nenhum esforço do jogador e em termos de mecânica ele segue a linha do remake do 2, porem com um foco voltado um pouco mais para a ação do que para aquele ""vai e volta pelo mapa carregando itens e evitando ser morto"", o que se reflete no acréscimo da mecânica de esquiva, que da mais possibilidades nos combates para o jogador. Mas a realidade triste desse jogo é que  ele é claramente uma versão cortada se comparada a obra original. Repare que eu disse ""cortado"" e não reimaginado ou reorganizada, partes inteiras da obra original foram simplesmente retiradas do jogo por pressa, o que é inadmissível. Isso é evidente não só pela curtíssima duração do jogo mas também porque não colocaram coisas novas no lugar das antigas e não existe um trabalho bom desenvolvimento de fatores do jogo (como história, personagens, construção de terror, etc). O diferencial máximo do terceiro título da serie era essa relação de perseguido e perseguidor que a protagonista deveria ter com aquele que seria seu NEMESIS no título, mas nem a construção dessa atmosfera foi consolidada direito. Como fã da serie e consumidor não espero simplesmente um jogo feito as pressas pra ganhar o dinheiro dos fãs que depois do remake do 2 se empolgaram com a possibilidade do remake do 3, esperava que a empresa se concentrasse em desenvolver o potencial do titulo ao seu máximo, o que claramente foi trocado por um puro imediatismo de lucro que pra mim nem faz tanto sentido assim.… Expand

As a fan of the resident evil franchise since game one I say this with a heavy heart, the Resident Evil 3 ""Re-imagination"" falls short. Lets begin by saying if you expect the game kind of changes RE2R made you RE2  you're going to have a bad time. This time they didn't just remove a few enemies and shorten levels. They removed over half the game content such as the clock tower, water treatment plant, and the park. What they did keep was critically reduced to either a few city blocks like down nostalgia corner, or a dynamic cinematic like uptown or the final boss nemesis. They also replaced Jills nostalgic return to RPD with a slapped together speed run of a few rooms with Carlos. Reduced the umbrella factory to a fee few seconds of nest re skined. Gave you a wolf boss fight re skinned with nemesis hound not just once but twice as the only only other boss fight of the game. And for some reason added a power station section that focuses on impregnating Jill via graphic oral technical rape... Legitimate not a joke. A side from this you get to pay full price for a half rendered side demo made from scrap environments left over from RE2R jammed together to allow your avatar to fumble through.

Just kill kill kill - just like RE2 - gorgeous. - it’s been a while since I’ve played the original but it feels relatively true to the original from what I remember. CONS- you get tired of Nemesis. It becomes a sigh and an eye roll - no more cool puzzles. - some stupid enemies that just feel out of place… Expand

The story is decent  and the gameplay is good. However it sucks that they cut a few things out for whatever reason and that ultimately made the game shorter. It also gets a little repetitive at the end. Overall, it's sort of a lackluster experience and the game isn't worth full price because it feels more like an expansion for RE2, I recommend that you buy the game when it's on sale.

I'm a hardcore RE fan that played most RE games (except the terrible ones), and I have a mixed feeling about this one. In my opinion, this is a brilliant edition that added a whole new spin to the game while preserving certain moments from the good old RE3 that we all remember. I definitely enjoyed playing it, and more importantly, I appreciated the face lift and the new changes that were introduced. The remake enabled me to play my old beloved RE3 once again after all those years, and on a much superior platform, while keeping me intrigued by ""what else is new here"". However, I feel that a few crucial events, moments or encounters from the old RE3 were missed or dismissed in the remake, and this was hard to ignore within the short play time that the remake has to offer. This game could have offered a lot more, but I was short and sweet, and definitely worth playing. Thanks to the legends of CAPCOM and I look forward to more remakes!… Expand

That's not a bad thing at all, many games fail to even meet the decent expectations that are set for them. Anyway, just like last years Resident Evil 2, it's a third person survival horror game with a short campaign but one that encourages you to play through it several times.This time around, the horror takes a big back seat for the sake of action which is fitting considering the original Resident Evil 3 did the same thing. This has it's pros and cons. While I would say this game is more fun to play with no additions like more frequent action as well as the satisfying dodge move, it's definitely not of a higher quality than Resi 2. I enjoy both very much but for different reasons and I'd say the reasons I enjoy Resi 2 matter just a bit more.The campaign is stripped down to give us one plotline this time, switching between characters at certain points instead of giving us two different campaigns... or, an inconsistent half assed two different campaigns in the case of the Resi 2 remake. For that very reason, I'm okay with there only being one campaign again. My biggest complaint with Resi 2 was the plot inconsistency between both campaigns, there is no way both campaigns can be canon simultaneously so this game eliminates that issue, even if it takes the easy way out.The game also felt a bit shorter than Resi 2. I started playing Resident Evil 3 the exact minute it was released, 12 o'clock midnight on April 3rd and I ended up finishing the game by 6:30 in the morning the same day. I totaled in about 5 hours of gameplay. For a first playthrough, I'd say that's short.The sections where you play as Carlos as opposed to Jill also fell short for me. There's a specific section in the game where you're forced to fight a horde of zombies for a few minutes which felt totally tacked on and out of place, it really really turned me off but it didn't last super long so ultimately, it didn't ruin the whole experience. It just felt so out of place, it only happens one time, (thank god) so it's without a doubt just gonna be remembered as that weird, out of place, forced action sequence as well as the worst part of the game.Anyway, I still had fun, enough to beat the whole game in one sitting from midnight until dawn. I've never done that for any game launch before and I did not expect this game to be the one I did it with first. The game was much less scary this time around and the story isn't as memorable but if you liked Resi 2 and want some more of that game, here you go.Let's hope the pandemic of the real world doesn't end up looking like Raccoon City.I beat this game in April of 2020.… Expand

Having a Tyrant hunt you down is now the new norm for Resident Evil, but the most feared of all will always be Nemesis. He quickly disappears into the cutscenes however, without as much of an impact as you would perhaps hope. Thankfully though, there are enough environment and enemy variations crammed into this short experience that you never get a chance to settle down and acquaint yourself with any one enemy type, and as a survival horror game that is exactly how you want to feel.

Not to mention, despite basically copying and pasting the same game with small adjustments each year, they manage to make it worse each year. It sucks! 2K sucks! And they need to fix their issues

So here's the short version. The game hasn't evolved much since I last played a 2k game actively, which was back in 2014. The servers are still lagging like crazy and everything costs an egregious amount of VC. On higher difficulty in MyCareer, it's pretty much 1v9. Your teammates can't hit a wide open shot if their life depended on it. Gameplaywise, there's still a heavy focus on animations, which more often than not cause you to get blocked, commit a turnover or just lead to your opponent scoring. Cheesy tactics like zigzagging haven't been fixed. Defending feels clunky and unresponsive. The entire MyTeam grinding has been cranked up to 1000, just for the sake of it (600 wins of TTO for a 95 OVR player when I can just get one with a locker code? What's the point?). Sometimes I can't even get into a game because the game is stuck on the loading screen, which forces one of the players to quit and get an automatic loss. All in all, I'm glad I got this game on sale, because there ain't no way in hell I'll ever pay full price for a game like ever again. As long as 2k has it's chokehold on the basketball license and no competition, I can't see them ever committing to something better than whatever the **** this garbage is supposed to be.… Expand

I literally have forced myself to play 8 minute quarters to attempt to have NBA games score above 60 points a game (actual real NBA games now always go at least over 100 points) Yet even with 8 minute quarters (super long quarters for a video game) this is impossible unless you play on All-Star or below but then the CPU cant make wide open threes with Steph Curry and wont score above 60 points a game ever (8 min quarters). Then above that difficulty you will make maybe 2/7 wide open threes with a shooter like Steph Curry. Not to mention every game is entirely scripted. There is no scoring if you play above All-Star unless it is a layup in the paint and every interior shot/driving shot or layup either ends in a make or a foul so the game stops every 30 seconds for free throws. A horrible game that is a beyond an inaccurate simulation of NBA basketball which is high scoring and sees a ton of jump shots made which includes a lot of threes, yet in this game I feel like im watching 80's college basketball (almost all scoring is in the paint)  where the only thing they added from the modern NBA is that every other drive to the basket ends in a foul, maybe the least exciting part of today's game..… Expand

However, its value will largely depend on how tolerant users are of a corny, repetitive story mode and mostly the same options as in previous editions. According to most of the web, 2K Games is building the next-gen versions of NBA 2K21 from the ground up to match the improved technology. Here’s to hoping they upgrade more than the graphics, while keeping the on-court play intact.

This game was so close to beating DMC3 S.E in my mind for best DMC game. The only problem is 1/3rd of the game is marred by this one. annoying. fragile. man.I absolutely hated playing as V. It was so boring I would actually fall sleep or I would have hand pain from mashing the attack buttons over, & over, & over, & over, again until the enemy eventually died.Nero & Dante were an absolute blast to play with. Both unique & complex. V was just mash both attack buttons until they die. Also jump out of the way sometimes. Completely boring & killed the flow of the game. I was planning on playing this game over & over again until I got to the hardest difficulty. I was planning on maxing my characters out. That was until I played as V & realized I would have to play 1/3rd of the game over & over again as that boring character. 2/3rd of this game is a 10 out of 10. It's just too bad that it's ruined by V. I honestly celebrate when he would go away or I would get to play as a different character. This game was absolutely perfect. If you could just pick who you want to play as for each mission, I wouldn't knock it a point. But the fact that you're forced to play as boring emo guy just kills a portion of the experience for me. I loved everything else this game was. The music, the style, the characters, the grandness of the way things are presented. 2/3rd's of a masterpiece.… Expand

Nier Automata had annoying tacked on RPG stuff. Dmc5 has neither. It's just pure action. There are 3 playable characters. Dante and Nero are great, V a little less so. He summons beasts to fight for him instead of direct combat. He takes some time to get used to, and I didn't like his character much, but overall he's a net positive. All 3 have FANTASTIC battle themes, but they play for EVERYTHING. They really do outstay their welcome. The great combat is still here. There are lots of cool additions to Dante's moveset (which I won't spoil here) and you can use them to great effect. One let down gameplay-wise is that the game is fairly easy on the normal mode. I don't why anyone would want a Dmc without challenge, so I highly recommend playing on the hard mode. I think 3 difficulty options would have been better, but it's a small nitpick. As I mentioned, V's character is bit of a let down, but that's not the only issue story-wise. The villain isn't really very menacing, and the game's final arc is never resolved, leading to a weak conclusion. However, this game is great in spite of all that. This game is a must-play for anyone who enjoys pure action games. Maybe it's a sort of relief after playing Gow2018. Either way, highly recommend.… Expand

I love the mechanics of this game, and it looks great. The problem is it feels more like an add on to Destiny 1. I think the amount of money for DLC is crazy. Think about it! For $20 more you could buy a new game. Seriously stop supporting this kind of behaviour.

Overall the base game is extremely lacking compared to the original. The gunplay is still amazing and very few FPS games are better than it. In the sequel, Bungie opted for a ""story"" with a defined villain ""Ghaul"". I think this effort was made just to say that they have a ""story"". I feel like this actually hurt the campaign when trying to cater the gameplay towards the story. The campaign was very boring to play and I would've preferred the storyless campaign of Destiny 1 because its campaign was fun to play. Don't even get me started that you can't use your sparrow until you beat the story. IO is extremely boring and the missions after it. Crucible is okay, but should not be looked as a very competitive experience and just as a gamemode made as an afterthought. The double primary meta is too slow and the flow of Crucible does not work. The strikes are fun, but they are in no way memorable or feel like they fit in the story. In Destiny 1, they tied strikes to the story as a ""final boss""/activity for the planet. For example Devil's Lair on Earth. I don't see any link to the story and unlike Destiny 1, I don't remember any of the strike bosses names. The raid feels like a raid, but I don't think it's very good.-Castellum is not very fun and is unnecessary. In bathers, I don't like that they force you to solo an ultra and you have to rely on others having good enough weapons to kill it themselves.-Dogs is just completely stupid. It's very buggy and you have to rely on the finicky AI of the dogs to not see your not very smart raidmates. Then you have to rely on their weapons being good to solo a dog and kill your dog fast enough to help their out.-Gauntlet is kind of too easy, but people for some reason can't wrap their hands around it.-Calus feels like an actual raid encounter, but the barriers in the alternate dimension can be buggy at times.Prestige Leviathan feels like a worthy challenge. I would only buy this if you loved Destiny as a franchise to accept this game's misdoings.And would wait for DLC to fix the game.… Expand

With Bungie taking Destiny 2 and with us all going into a new era of Destiny, i think it is time to do my review now. Okay so lets begin with the story. Now I know that Destiny’s in game story is not really anything special and the real story is online in the grimoire system or now in the collections tab for the lore section but I must say I really liked how the cabal destroyed the tower and took the traveler with our powers. Although i must say that the character development and the way the characters act and talk are beautiful. Cayde-6 is still my favorite character in the Destiny franchise due to his attitude towards everything and how he’s a joker/comedian. The weapon system and armor system at first was okay but now as i’m making this review it has became much better. I REALLY loved how they added random rolls back to which give tons and tons of replay value to certain events. Okay so now with the end game content. At first you had the nightfall and the Leviathan Raid which was okay for awhile but got boring/repetitive. Now we have tons of raids to which i think the number is 5/6, we also have now many different types of Nightfall which is nice and pretty cool if you ask me. We also now have a new activity called Nightmares to which have certain guns/rolls to which is REALLY cool but VERY challenging if your not high enough of power. The final thing that i would add is how the exploration on the worlds have been upgraded AMAZINGLY compared to the last game and the same thing can be said about the public events too. However, I will say that the everversce store is packed with goodies but sadly you need silver to which you can ONLY get from spending real money but they are fixing it as I'm making this review. All in all, this game is basically a slight downgrade in my opinion from the first game but it doesn’t do a bad job as being a sequel to the franchise but I personally prefer the first game.… Expand

Mas o último ovo demorou mais a partir, e a mamã começou a ficar nervosa…Finalmente, a casca quebrou e, para surpresa da mamã pata, de lá saiu um patinho muito diferente de todos os seus outros filhos.- Este patinho feio não pode ser meu! Exclama a mamã pata.- Alguém te pregou uma partida. Afirma a vizinha galinha.Os dias passaram e, à medida que os patinhos cresciam, o patinho feio tornava-se cada vez mais diferente dos outros patinhos.Cansado de ser gozado pelos seus irmãos e por todos os animais da quinta, o patinho feio decide partir.Irmãos fazem pouco do patinho feioMesmo longe da quinta, o patinho não conseguiu paz, pois os seus irmãos perseguiam-no por todo o lago, gritando:- És o pato mais feio que nós alguma vez vimos!E, para onde quer que fosse, todos os animais que encontrava faziam troça dele.- Que hei de eu fazer? Para onde hei de ir? O patinho sentia-se muito triste e abandonado.Com a chegada do inverno, o patinho cansado e cheio de fome encontra uma casa e pensa:- Talvez aqui encontre alguém que goste de mim! E assim foi.O patinho passou o inverno aconchegadinho, numa casa quentinha e na companhia de quem gostava dele.

Um recém-chegado! Gritou uma das crianças. Todas as outras crianças davam gritos de alegria.- E é tão bonito! Dizia outra.Bonito?... De quem estarão a falar? Pensou o patinho feio.De repente, o patinho feio viu que todos olhavam para ele e, ao ver o seu reflexo na água, viu um grande e elegante cisne.- Oh!... Exclama o patinho admirado. Crianças e outros cisnes admiravam a sua beleza e cumprimentavam-no alegremente.Afinal ele não era um patinho feio mas um belo e jovem cisne!A partir desse dia, não houve mais tristezas, e o patinho feio que agora era um belo cisne, viveu feliz para sempre!

While I have played this game into oblivion, I find that the yearly charge (which cost as much as a new game every time) is getting to be too much. I hope they find a way to continue expanding this game, but at a much lower cost to the consumer. Gameplay wise, it’s always been pretty good, but story wise it’s mostly been lackluster other than forsaken.

                                Even if Bungie backtracks on some of these horrendous missteps, there’s evidence that the dev team is either flailing around without a clear idea of the experience they want to present, or even worse, they’re happy to offer the least amount of mediocre content possible until the player base starts pushing back. When free-to-play titles like Warframe and Let it Die seem monumentally more generous and offer vastly more entertainment value than a triple-A sixty dollar release built with a budget large enough to feed whole continents, it’s clear that something has gone horribly wrong.

                                It’s this sense of streamlined player experience that really defines Destiny 2.  Where the first game had you grinding for hours just to experience increasingly diminishing returns, this is a sequel that trims away its processor’s frustrations, firmly putting fun first.

                                Destiny 2 is tough to compare to other shooters or games, but it is evidently a better title than part 1. The campaign is longer, the progression makes more sense, the structure is more satisfying and the sheen and splendor on the various planets entices even more. Destiny is comparable with its predecessor after the add-on The Taken King, and is therefore a more solid foundation for the coming months of content.

Destiny 2 still fails to live up to the studios behind it. To preface: I've been a fan of Destiny ever since (2012?) where I saw the art for the Titan subclass, ever then I excitedly awaited the release of Destiny 1, and while Destiny 1 had its flaws, it's the first year was some of the most fun and memorable times I've had playing a video game. The same cannot be said for this game.Destiny 2 still fails to live up to the studios behind it. To preface: I've been a fan of Destiny ever since (2012?) where I saw the art for the Titan subclass, ever then I excitedly awaited the release of Destiny 1, and while Destiny 1 had its flaws, it's the first year was some of the most fun and memorable times I've had playing a video game. The same cannot be said for this game. While Destiny 2 has an actual story compared to Destiny 1 that had none. It still just falls back on an exciting and interesting first 30 mins then falls into mediocrity, as it relies on cliches, touches on interesting concepts and ideas that you'd expect from watching the trailers (At least the D1 trailers, D2 relies on the Call of Duty like way of storytelling.) but this game never is confident enough to go deep into interesting themes, and rarely likes to have our characters weak. And while this review is mainly for the base game, the Forsaken DLC story has the same issue, first 30 mins are amazing and emotional than just drop and die. That's kind of the issue with Destiny, it seems like so much more than it is. You want it to be a World of Warcraft like SCI-FI MMO, while it can deliver on the SCI-FI part, the MMO? Not so much. Destiny 2 (in its current state 9/3/2019 and it still was as boring during launch) is a weakly cobbled mess. There's little incentive to do anything anymore, you rarely need the best exotic gear to defeat a boss, just pick a loadout from this range of Subclass and a massive handful of weapons and you're ready to go! Which isn't really a bad thing, I actually enjoy not having to have one of two rocket launchers to let me raid with people (A feature of Destiny 1's DLC) But there's no incentive to do the raids, there's no incentive to anything really besides FASHION. As the gear you obtain will scale with you to the max, you don't need to beat the hardest challenges to become the strongest level. You just need to play enough. This game will hand you out items like Christmas, hiding away other more unique weapons behind long, (which is sometimes bad) and sometimes needlessly long quests. They vary in how pointless they are, with some being fun to do and others being a needlessly long slog, I'm all up for a challenge, just not intentionally wasting my time grinding a boring activity, which is what Destiny 2 becomes in the end. If you're new, you'll have plenty to do. It'll be fun, and cool and exploring Destiny 2's environments will be so cool and fun, getting exotics and legendaries will feel like a blast! Then you reach the max light and the game becomes a grind, there's no reason to keep playing besides fashion, any loot you want is too easily accessible (not saying it's EASY to get, it's just TOO for how hard it should be) The game incentivizes grinding through it's challenges and loot systems which is why I am writing this review, this is my fourth time I've been burnt out from this game. And won't be playing it again until Shadowkeep comes out, just for me to get bored of that as well.… Expand

The story of the campaign is less confused than in the original, but it’s not exactly good either. It went from painstakingly bad to ordinary, which is at least an improvement. Destiny 2 is the gaming equivalent of a Michael Bay movie.

I had fun with this game playing with friends, but that's not much of a compliment. Apex Legends is competent at what it does, nothing more. As a result, the game is as good as your friends. It's free, so you might as well play it with someone if you have the time. Just don't try it by yourself.

Though its Season One rollout has been disappointing content-wise and its visual flair remains bland, Apex Legends still has the solid foundation necessary for a free-to-play shooter to survive in the long run. And with 50 million players reached in its first month, it's not like it's slowing down anytime soon. We're all jumpmasters now.

Began playing the game since Season 1 and it improves more and more up until now (Season 8).As usual for BR games, you and either 1 or two partners drop into one of three rotating maps with 57 other players. You land, loot, kill, loot, kill, until you're the last one alive, pressured by the closing Ring that does increasing damage with each round A lot of features are done right. A player is assigned the Jump Master that their partners stick with when they start dropping, with the choice of splitting off or dropping solo. The Ping system is very well designed, telling your teammates where you're going, attacking, looting, defending, and many other pinging features like asking for ammo or attachments. The weapons are well balanced, though not perfect. The meta weapons right now being the Spitfire and R-99.There's 16 legends to choose from, all with their own Passive, Tactical and Ultimate abilities. They all are diverse, including a non-binary Bloodhound and a gay Gibraltar.  You'll grow to love these Legends as they communicate to eachother with special character-specific dialogue. There's also a series of comics each season that you can read, which explores specific legends in detail The maps are great,from the classic King's Canyon to the polar World's Edge to the massive but beautiful Olympus. Unfortunately the game is plagued with bugs and glitches that don't fully destroy the game but prevent me from giving it a 10, alongside their unpredictable servers. There's also skill based matchmaking in both public matches AND Ranked modes, which might make your gaming experience exhausting and difficult to improve overtime.Otherwise, if you're into Battle Royales, absolutely give the game a try. If not, I'd still suggest a playthrough or two. After all, it's free.… Expand

An online futuristic multiplayer team based game which contains both fps adrenaline and coordinated gameplay. It's really an enjoyable and engaging experience, both in defence and attack. Every hero feels unique, the maps are well-designed and, in addition to the classic game modes, the arcade game modes are fun and original.So, why this game isn't a 10? Well, for two particular points:1) The game is living a real ""content drought"", adding very few new things every two or so months, especially since Role Que was added (but also before this period, which was august 2019); this because Blizzard has announced Overwatch 2 and almost every new type of content will be left for that game, leaving Overwatch with its stale yearly events routine. The only things that are really new are the few skins that are added during the aforementioned events.2) The multiplayer core experience is based on teamwork and coordination, especially in competitive, where people are supposed to communicate; however, this doesn't happen very often, particularly on console. And when you cannot coordinate your team, you are most likely going to lose and get frustrated. Yes, frustrated, because you clearly know what you have to do in order to win, but you can't because your teammates are not performing properly their role, leaving the whole squad in the tide. Infact, always play with some friends, not only because it is more fun, but also because if you are going for solo que, you are left to the fate of your teammates (for real), resulting in  a much more difficult and, again, frustrating experience in order to climb into new ranks. In conclusion: Overwatch is a really good game, one of the best fps games ever made, but play it with some friends, otherwise it will be an exhausting experience, most of the times (especially in competitive).… Expand

Its idea of only being a 6 vs 6 has been tested through out the years and gave the players different game modes that at time looked  ridiculous. Game modes like Lucio ball (rocket league) Junkerstein Revenge(zombies) Mei's snowball and yeti hunt and last but not least Archive (story events) shows the potential that this project has. Although Balancing heroes come become a problem , blizzard is always making sure to place that bar and find the best Meta. Other game modes such as capture the flag, death match and others were introduced and very recently they release the workshop where people come with unique ideas to make their pwn game modes such as parkour , infinity stones, flappy bird ,death room and plenty plenty of others… Expand

These loot boxes are completely optional with only cosmetics, which easily unlocked through the leveling up system. They don’t you forced to pay for in game microtransactions to be better than others. Many other games do this and I respect overwatch from steering away from it.

When you win you earn 25 rating points. It doesnt take a mathemetician to realize even if you win 50% of the games, you rating will descend until you are paired with terrible teammates who have long given up and just want to sabotage your game. The game is great if you have five, high-level players to group up with, and its awful if you dont. Not sure why i care to learn 35 different heros and their abilities while being permanently stuck with the under 500 rated players. I easily earned 2300 rating in the placement matches, then most games after are a loss from there. I tried this twice and it happened twice. Huge loss in rating for a match loss, not so much gain at a win. The more you expect teamwork, the more they will passive aggressively not help you. Popularity contest rules apply to whether or not a player will help you. It helps if you are LGBT it seems. Strange to have sexual orientation based prejudices The quickplay is fun 1 in 3, or maybe 1 in 4 games, but the teamwork and discipline is even less in quickplay. I believe games with ratings should only reflect individual performance.

In Overall I would not recommend playing it alone, it is way more fun playing with a team.The Story of Overwatch is interesting, but I wish Blizzard will make a campaign for Overwatch 2 so we can learn more about the Overwatch World.BUT. I think this game gets more credit than it actually deserves. I don't think that the Game is worth 60$ just for Teamwork and Multiplayer; It is fun, of course but it still is not worth 60 bucks. If there was a Campaign, this would be one of the best 60 Bucks I have ever spent. Verdict; 8/10. While it might not feel like it is worth 60 Bucks, it is worth getting the game because the big amount of fun Teamwork, just not full priced. 2020 Edit: It now goes often on sale for 20$ and Bllizzard released a lot of new free content.

All players know that each map has a specific character to be used in a strategy, that without exaggeration, all players repeat the same thing. For example Hanamura, who uses wrecking ball to spin and knock everyone down. In this type of map, which one team attacks and the other defends, it is much more difficult to attack, because the game is unbalanced because of Bastion, Torbjorn, Wrecking Ball, and others. I play on Xbox, and it takes thirty minutes to find a competitive match. And even taking a long time to find the match, it’s not because it’s more difficult to find the match, because they separate people by level and ranking, because if you’re level 100, you’ll play against level 1000 players, when I play with a full team pre formed by friends of mine, the opposing team is harmed, because my friends and I are talking to each other and we know how to communicate well. In a game like this, communication is very important, they should only be players from pre-formed teams, against other pre-formed teams. Even though it takes a long time, a bronze person plays against a platinum or diamond, all this proves that the delay is not because it is separated by platform, level and skill, it is just that there is no one playing. It is impossible to play twenty-four competitive matches in one day, because you will only be in the queue for twelve hours. The game has no updates, all year round are the same events, Christmas, birthday, archives, Chinese New Year, Halloween and summer games. The only difference each year is that it launches some new outfits that cost three times the price of others, and if you don't have points to buy them, and the event will end, you can't buy the item you want, the only way is buying loot boxes, which are very expensive and you will never win what you want in them. The most relevant updates they had was the launch of a new character, but they haven't released a new one in seven months. There are so few players that in each game there are at least two people on the enemy team that I have seen before, because they are always the same players. The competitive ones are very bad, it only serves to make you angry, get points to buy a golden weapon.Os critérios de classificação são discriteriosos, nas partidas primeiras partidas de cada temporada servem para estabelecer teu ranking conforme tua habilidade. Em suporte, quanto mais cura fizer melhor o teu rank. Um amigo meu conseguiu platina, eu fiz o triplo de cura que ele e ganhei mais partidas que ele, e peguei bronze. Os servidores são instáveis, a qualquer momento tu é desconectado da partida e o jogo te dá penalidade por abandono de partida. Tu fica por um tempo determinado sem poder jogar. Se tu for desconectado mais vezes, o tempo de banimento aumenta, com apenas alguns banimentos, tu é banido permanentemente da temporada, e precisa esperar meses para poder jogar de novo.

Anyone writing a review this late in the life of this game has probably played a very large amount of the competitive play list, which is great fun when played with friends, but kind of discredits their super negative response to this game. The competitive experience for me, as a player who grinded to the heights of Master rank, was ultimately was caused me to dislike the game. The nuanced bugs and issues in terms of interactions between heroes is hardly noticeable to a player who isn't taking the game seriously. My friends who played casually enjoyed the game for a long time and moved on not because they started to hate this game but moved on because they found a new game they loved as well. The fact that I took this game seriously by playing the competitive modes made me more aware of the issues that existed. Those issues usually revolved around hero balance or interactions and bugs that made competitive moments feel out of my own control at times. I truly believe that if someone were to pick this game up for the first time today, not taking it seriously and trying to be competitive with it, they would completely enjoy the robust roster of heroes and the plethora of abilities/modes/maps that are available to play around with and have fun. I will say before ending that this game shines with friends when you're messing around and joking together. When played alone it can get a bit draining as it's very intense and high action.… Expand

Although a great game if you are just going for the casual play through. if you are like me and many other people you ply crash games to 100% and this game is one of the worst games to 100%. The level design is amazing the music is very good, I wouldn’t say it’s better than the original trilogy but it’s still good music. But the difficulty spike when you are going a complete play through is absurd and unreasonable. Having to get platinum on the time trails is next to impossible. I found myself getting gold on the time trails and still having to improve by 30 seconds to get to platinum! The amount of time you will have to replay the same level over and over is ridiculous all so you get get all 6 gems per level. And once you done with that Once you have gotten all the gems in every level you then have to once again replay the same levels over again in the new mode called N.Verted mode. In this mode you play through the exact same levels you just played 6-8 times each again but the level has a twist to it but that twist does not warrant playing 6-8 times again to get the 6 gems AGAIN. The placement of the boxes in this game is almost just a betting game to know where they are. Most of the time it’s in spots that you would never even see even if you move the camera. Once again to do not hate this game I think this game is great but the amount of requirements it takes to fully complete this game is way too much… Expand

The artstyle while not what I associate with crash is really beautiful and bring vibes of rayman legends which being compared to is never a bad thing. The soundtrack is decent, not as good as the originals or many other crash games however  they prove enjoyable while playing but not much beyond that (I liked how Cortex's theme was incorporated in all his levels tho). As for the gameplay it is a good as ever. The double jump is added to crash's standard moveset from the start allowing the game to be designed around it. He handles like a dream in these brilliant levels that really test your skills. This is easily the hardest game in the series but it's always fair. The game takes the level philosophy of mario where each level introduces its own gimmick and it is iterated    on throughout the stage. Whether it be a pirate ship, a jaunt over rooftops above a festival or the prehistoric era every level has it's own sense of style and at it's very best tropical freeze one of the best platformers of all time comes to mind. The 4 masks also add to the gameplay variety in stages as at certain intervals you can phase objects in or out or slow down time or flip gravity. These add depth and puzzle like elements that fit's incredibly well with standard crash fair. the vehicles are massively turned down in this game as there are only 4 of them and they only appear once or twice each and only as sections of a level not a full level .  The devs were confident in there platforming design and that the masks would create enough variety to keep the game fresh and I'm glad to say they nailed it. Replacing full vehicle levels are new playable characters in Tawna,Cortex and dingodile, all of which have 5 or 6 levels each. They break up the gameplay nicely as they all play very differently from crash and the good news for people who want pure crash action is that only one level with each character is required to beat the game. One thing that I didn't like however is after playing one of these characters sections you have to playthrough part of a level you already played as crash with slightly different box placement, which I personally found like a waste of time even if they are fun to bounce around in. The bosses are all well designed and fun to fight to that beating them down is fun from beginning to end. The game is packed with extra content with each level having 12 gems relics and the ridiculous perfect relics. Needless to say if your a crash fan like me  you will be kept busy   for a long time. The remakes where the groundwork but with this game crash can scream he's back and he isn't going away again any time soon.… Expand

Crash Bandicoot 4 Its About Time, sin duda alguna, es un buen juego, y no solo es que sea un buen juego, sino que si no contamos los remakes es uno de los mejores juegos de Crash no hechos por ND. Sin embargo, para ser la cuarta entrega canónica luego de mucho tiempo, deja bastante que desear, a tal punto que al menos para mi, no considero que este a la altura. Hablemos del diseño de niveles, estos son bastante creativos la verdad, y es de los puntos mas fuertes del juego. Las mascaras cuanticas tambien ayudan bastante a esto, al menos en algunas ocasiones, ya que en otros niveles alentan bastante la experiencia y honestamente prefiero mucho mas los poderes del Warped. Tambien mascaras como Ika Ika a veces se bugean pero son raras las ocasiones.En cuanto a los jefes creo que fueron muy decepcionantes (salvo N Gin), junto con la historia, misma que contradice o no explica muchos elementos de la trilogia original, asi como no explotar nada de los viajes interdimensionales quedandose muy a medias en este sentido. La historia parecio hecha a las apuradas, y si bien en cierta parte ""Crash nunca se caracterizo por tener una gran importancia en la historia"", minimamente hubieran aclarado los huecos que habia dejado ND como que habia pasado con la Tawna original, o la historia de Aku Aku y Uka Uka, en lugar de dejar mas dudas y preguntas. Los nuevos personajes parecieron metidos con calzador, y no aportan nada a la trama, lo mismo con personajes como Dingodile, que podran ser divertidos y lo que quieran pero no aportan nada. De hecho, otra vez tenemos el problema de los juegos de PS2. Ridiculizan bastante a los personajes. La tetralogia original nunca fue de humor absurdo, de hecho, siempre iban al grano en la gran mayoria de ocasiones. El humor era algo mucho mas sutil dado en muy pocas ocasiones como las animaciones de algunos personajes y ya. Para ser una secuela de Warped, este cambio de tono estilo Twinsanity no cuadra para nada. Y el humor en si... juzgandolo como tal... es muy malo, yo soy un cinefilo y puedo decir que practicamente copiaron y pegaron las mismas bromas de malas peliculas y series de animacion en Crash 4. Incluso juegos como Twinsanity tienen mejor comedia! Y eso es mucho decir la verdad... Y el final es super anticlimatico y no aporta nada, todas las escenas de Cortex y Tawna se sienten muy forzadas. Hubiera preferido una historia mas sencilla que funcionara, con conceptos interesantes de transfondo como en la tetralogia, mas que una historia que aspirara a demasiado, pero que al final les saliera muy mal.Y ahora siguiendo con la jugabilidad, este juego es muy dificil, demasiado. Cosa que... no es malo! Para nada. O al menos no lo seria si tuviera un reto justo... cosa que... lo tiene! Al menos en su modo normal como ya dije... Pero en su 106%... Es una tortura. Facilmente el Crash mas dificil jamas hecho. Y esto es generalmente por mal diseño. Muchas de las cajas suelen estar en lugares demasiado ocultos, los niveles de vehículos tienen controles muy cuestionables (incluso peores que los del WOC), debido a esto te suele el juego castigar demasiado por exigirte demasiado ya sea con las reliquias de platino o las n sanamente perfectas, sumado a la perspectiva que es muy mala la verdad lo que te provocara muertes injustas en varias ocasiones, y esto es debido a que los niveles de la trilogia eran mucho mas sencillos mientras que en Crash 4 son mas complejos. Y no, ignorar el contenido secundario solo porque ""no me gusta"", no quitara que este mal diseñado, ademas de que es obligatorio para conseguir el final verdadero por lo que sigue siendo obligatorio conseguirlo. La trilogía original nunca fue tan difícil al contrario de lo que se suele creer! ND quito Stormy Ascent del primer Crash por ser demasiado dificil ademas de reducir bastante la dificultad en general y el diseño complicado en Crash 2 y 3, asi que porque hacer Crash 4 tan dificil? Como dije, los juegos difíciles pueden ser buenos, pero hay que saber hasta que punto elevar la dificultad para que no llegue a frustrar. Porque no, un juego difícil no lo hace automáticamente bueno, y menos si su propósito es castigar al jugador con un diseño injusto. Por otra parte, un juego fácil no hace que sea malo o inferior, siempre y cuando mantenga al jugador entretenido con mecánicas bien implementadas.Y hablando de cosas mas menores, la banda sonora al menos a mi no me parecio tan memorable... nada mas que decir.Crash 4 es un buen juego, eso es innegable. Pero carece de la simplicidad y accesibilidad que hacían a los juegos originales tan buenos incluso ahora y ademas de no innovar tanto jugable como gráficamente (porque seamos honestos, Crash 4 no innova en nada, recicla muchas ideas de anteriores entregas, y esta lejos de verse como un juego nextgen). Entiendo a la gente que lo considera el mejor Crash, ya que es un juegazo, ademas, admiro lo que TFB hizo de continuar con la saga de ND, solo falto pulirse.… Expand

I do think that this is a very good game and a lot of hard work went into it but after I complete this game, I'm not sure I'll ever play it again. At least not a new playthrough. I love much of the level design and the abilities that the masks provide, and the game is just so colorful and nicely detailed. However, while I expect for a Crash game to be challenging, the level of frustration I'm feeling here makes me not want to play for any more than one level at a time. I don't want it to be too easy of a game but at the same time, I either find myself taking breaks or playing other games almost immediately. The new modern mode is appreciated for the simple fact that it allows for you to have unlimited lives but that still doesn't make the game any less annoying for me. But retro mode is there too. I barely get boxes as it is now because by the time I get to a certain point in the level, I've died so many times to where I don't care about getting the Collectibles. I just want to finish. I rate the game an 8 because the fact that it frustrates me doesn't make it a bad game. The quality is there and it lives up to what these games are known for if you ask me. But be warned. It'll stress you out. I'm embarrassed to say that a game can get me that worked up but this one definitely has.… Expand

The vehicles handle horribly, especially the polar bear and part of it might be its' tiny hitbox to get all boxes.I tried going through the game without walkthrough and everytime i see one or two boxes missing my initial excitements turns a little sourer. Was it really necessary to hide one or two boxes so well? It's not fun.Overall, i would say that if you want to go through casually, it's an amazing experience.

                                Crash Bandicoot 4 is a worthy addition to the Crash legacy. It captures the spirit, fun, and challenge of the original games, and adds a lot more that genuinely makes the experience even better rather than simply padding out the gameplay. The game is certainly challenging and the levels could probably use a few more checkpoints, but the number in the game is truer to the spirit of the originals than modern gaming standards. A little perseverance will get you through the game, but it’s going to take a little work if you want to be a Crash completionist. Overall it’s a great platform game that perfectly blends the old and the new into a fun new experience.

The Unreal Engine 4 powered visuals brings the series into 2020 while Toys for Bob has kept to the original source material while adding some new gameplay elements, a personal touch so to speak. What has also made the jump (no pun intended) to this sequel though is the difficulty and control issues of the past. I really do wish the game was more accessible to new and younger fans alike, as some people may be turned off by this, but I don’t think it’s fair to heavily penalize the game for this fact, as it still is what made the series what it is. Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time is truly the best game in the series and I do hope we see another one on the upcoming next-generation consoles.

Somebody give them a medal of honour for their outstanding service in the field I mean how are you going to produce a game at a time like this when you can’t even provide guarantees to your consumers that their relatively within reason safe when playing the game that the game is to stay just that a game giving everything that goes on in the world and if you can’t which you can’t I’m curious as to why call of duty haven’t stepped down from the role as I vote for one of no confidence in the team. Am I going overboard? No. It is clear to me that game developers once again have failed to put the correct amount of work into their games and thus not just let their consumers down but really shown everybody they have no idea what the **** to do. It really is appalling to see.

I've spent too much time trying to fix the graphics and get around dev bugs that make this game unplayable. Graphics randomly glitches out with textures all over the place, killstreaks randomly not activating, sometimes lighting is really bright, or everything is rainbow neon and it's unplayable. There are so many hackers and exploiters all the time in Warzone, there are always players who are invisible, spamming non-lethal grenades, exploiting glitches. A lot of the missions and unlocks don't track properly. All of these issues are widely known in the community, but Activision doesn't do anything about it because it doesn't make them any money. I've spent over $500 on this game with the season passes and cod points, but when I talk to a customer service agent, he said they don't care about me as a customer, and that all they care about is taking my money, anything else they can't help me with at all.

I've never played a game more shallow, devoid of life, and lacking than Skyrim. I'm sure you're thinking ""But there's so much to do in this game! How can you ever get tired of it?!"" Every single quest in the game is as shallow as a kiddy pool. Add to that the terrible voice acting and writing and you have a game that isn't worth your time or money. The writing might be the worst part about the game. This game feels like they got a bunch of high school students to write it. It's about your character (the Dragonborn, which is a name i can't say without cracking up) being chosen as ""the One"" to defeat Alduin (A dragon who, surprise surprise, is going to destroy the world). I've definitely never heard that one before (Sarcasm). I would go into detail, but what's the point? You already know how it ends. The gameplay is what makes skyrim terrible. Here's a summary of it. You go into a town, talk to somebody who tells you to go talk to somebody in a town on the complete opposite end of the map and then you walk to the next town. Then that guy usually tells you to go talk to somebody in a town all the way back where i basically was. And then you walk to that town, and that guy will make you do some meaningless errand, and then the mission ends. Now imagine doing that over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over. You can technically fast travel to these places, but you can only fast travel to places once you've been there. By that time, there's only a few missions left. You're basically forced to walk everywhere. That's the main problem of skyrim. It's a glorified walking simulator. Besides the main missions, there's nothing to do in skyrim. There are technically a lot of side quests, but there so short and pointless that you get bored of them fast. There's a lot of dungeons, but you quickly realize that they're all the same. You enter, kill a bunch of enemies, make it to the boss, and once you've defeated him, you learn a spell and collect some treasure. That also gets old very fast. You can also get married and adopt kids, but again, there's no depth or detail in the system. You get an amulet from a guy in a temple, and then you talk to a random person, and then ask them to marry you. That's it. Adopting is even worse. You literally just talk to a random kid, ask them if you can adopt them, and again, that's it. You don't even have to pay for anything. The biggest gripe i have with this game is the fact that it's not an RPG. None of the choices you make affect the story. You're forced to play the same generic hero role Bethesda wants you to play. I tried to be mean to everybody, yet the game doesn't let you. The little bit of ""customization"" this game has is also (are you ready for it?) shallow. All you can do is make outfits out of various things you collect, which should be awesome, but there's no unique aspect to it. it's the same outfit that everybody else can make. What's the fun in that? Oh yeah, and the game's buggy as hell to boot. There's been several times where i fell through the world, several dragons became unkillable, and the game crashed at several points for no reason. This was on the latest patch of the game. The graphics are nothing to write home about. Everything just looks plain and drab. Some of the valleys and peaks look nice, but most things just look...dull. The music, while good, isn't anything special. When you compare it to other scores by Jeremy Soule, it feels like he wrote this on Auto-Pilot. There aren't many memorable pieces outside of the Main theme. It truly blows my mind how a game this terrible can be praised like this.… Expand

Some adventure? And are you ok with seeing blood and hearing mild language? If you are you should try playing Skyrim: Elder Scrolls V special edition! It’s the all in one adventure game of the ages! It is personally my favorite game I have ever played and all though it came out a long time ago it is still super, super fun to play. You can even get a horse, a dog, and a friend to help you fight dragons. You can complete quests, clear caves, join guilds, and even become a mage. In the Skyrim main storyline, you are the legendary Dragonborn, and you have to join sides with either the stormcloacks or the imperials in order to save Skyrim from collapse. I have played so far, I have played for maybe 15 hours straight, and even I haven’t gotten very far. The main storyline lasts about 30 hours but there are so many side quests it should take 60-70 hours. If you arent the violent type you could try trading to earn your coin. If you want to you can buy a house in most cities, and you are able to adopt two children and get married. Another thing you can do is build a house. Building a house makes the house much larger and you can choose which rooms you want, but it costs much more if you don’t want to gather all the resources yourself. Those are some of the many reasons I love Skrim and that’s why I recommend it. There are many games I play but this one is by far my favorite. So next time you’re bored and trying to find a game to play, try Skyrim. Skyrim does not work on a PlayStation five and may contain some stuff that may not be appropriate for all ages.… Expand
